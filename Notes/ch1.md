# chapter 1

## what is algorithmes?

    it is a dequence of a computational steps that  transform the input into output
    for sovlving a specified problem.

## what kinds of problems are solved by algorithms?
  - sorting huge amount of  ( the Human Genome Project)

  - finding good routes on which the data will travel (search engines)

## Why are NP-complete problems interesting?
 - first :  no one knows whether or not efficient algorithms exist for NP-complete problems.
 - Second : if an efficient algorithm
exists for any one of them, then efficient algorithms exist for all of them.

 - Third :  small change to the problem statement can cause
a big change to the efficiency of the best known algorithm.
 - If you can show that the problem is NP-complete, you can instead
spend your time developing an efficient algorithm <br>that gives a **good**,
 but not the best possible, solution.

## Parallelism

In order to elicit the best performance from multicore computers,
we need to design algorithms with parallelism in mind.

## Why do we study the Algorithmes ?

the algorithms that are efficient in terms of time or space.

## Efficiency
Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in
their efficiency.<br>
As an example, we know that insertion sort, takes time roughly equal to (c1*n^2) to sort n items,<br>
and merge sort, takes time roughly equal to (c2 * n * lg n )to sort n items,once the input size n
becomes large enough, <br> merge sortâ€™s advantage of lg n vs. n 
will more than compensatefor the difference in constant factors.
